# Personal repository

This is your personal repository for EDH 7916: Contemporary Research
in Higher Education. You should have the following directory
structure:

```
student_<your_last_name>/
|
|__ assignments/
|__ data/
|__ lessons/
|__ scripts/
|__ working/

```

You should also have a `.gitignore` file that I've started. I've
included a number of common file types that don't need to be pushed to
your GitHub remote. You can still have these files in your local
directory, but they shouldn't push to the remote. If you think a file
type should be allowed, let me know and I'll consider changing it.
