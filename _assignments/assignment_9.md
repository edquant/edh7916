I have been opinionated throughout this course (and in lesson 10 in
particular) about the best ways to organize a quantitative data
workflow. Considering all of that, please answer the following two
questions in a Markdown (`*.md`) or RMarkdown (`*.Rmd`) file, giving
about half of a page to each answer:

1. What organizational/work flow practice that I _have_ discussed do
   you think is unnecessary or impractical for daily data analytic
   tasks? Why? Keep in mind that practice doesn't have to include
   using R, but could instead mean using SPSS, Excel, _etc_. Also,
   it's not a trick or gotcha question! I want your (well considered)
   thoughts.
1. What organizational/work flow practice have I _not_ included that
   you think would help reduce error or improve reproducibility? Why?

#### Submission details

- Save your script (`<lastname>_assignment_10.md` or
  `<lastname>_assignment_10.Rmd`) in your `scripts` directory.
- Push changes to your repo (the new script and new folder) to GitHub
  prior to the next class session.
