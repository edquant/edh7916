From the syllabus:

> For your final project, you must produce a 3-5 page report on a higher
> education topic of interest. The report should be a combination of
> writing, tables, and figures, have minimal citations (if any), and be
> fully reproducible with minimal effort. You must use data that is
> either publicly available or that can be shared with others (no IRB
> restrictions). Everyone will submit three preliminary assignments in
> addition to the final report.

**This assignment represents the final report.**

For your final report, I need:

1.  A clearly formatted RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) file that will build your
    report
2.  Either:
      - A copy of your data
      - *Very clear* instructions on how to get your data

Your report will be graded according to the final report rubric below.

#### Submission details

  - Upload to our CANVAS course site no later than 11:59 p.m. EDT on the
    due date
  - Save your file as: `<name>_final_report.Rmd` (if submitting an Rmd
    file) where your last name replaces `<name>` (*e.g.*
    `skinner_final_report.Rmd`)
