***NOTE** This assignment needs to be completed by the start of the next
class. That means everything pushed to your remote GitHub repo before
class starts. If you are unsure whether you have successfully pushed
your changes, check the online version of your repo at GitHub.com. If
you can see your changes there, I can see them too.*

*Remember, I encourage you to save your work, commit smaller changes,
and push to your remote GitHub repo often rather than wait until the
last minute.*

Your final project will be to produce a 3-5 page reproducible report on
an education topic of your choosing. It should:

  - contain a combination of writing, tables, and figures
  - have minimal citations
  - be fully reproducible with minimal effort

The sophistication of your analyses should be commensurate with your
statistical training so far. That said, I’m generally expecting
descriptive analyses targeted at sophisticated, but non-technical
audiences. By far the most important aspects of the report are that your
underlying code follows the good practices we learn over the semester
and that **the final report is reproducible (by me) with minimal
effort**.

To facilitate the last item it is a requirement that **everyone must use
publicly available data.** For purposes of this project, a publicly
available data set is one that anyone can, today, download from a
website. This restriction, therefore, excludes data you’ve received from
your advisor, that you’ve collected yourself, or that one could
theoretically get by emailing an administrator or author of a paper.

To help you get started, your assignment this week is to

1.  brainstorm a topic of interest
2.  find a publicly-available data set that will allow you examine that
    topic in a short descriptive analysis
3.  begin reading through the technical report and codebook to see which
    variables you might use

I would recommend using of the [NCES panel data
sets](https://nces.ed.gov/OnlineCodebook) or
[IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/login.aspx), but I’m open
to others.

Create a new folder called `final_project` in your student repo. Submit
a Markdown file called `final_project_dataset_<last_name>.md` with the
following information:

  - Name and link to data set you plan to use
  - 1-2 paragraph(s) on your topic idea, with at least a sentence or two
    about how the data set you’ve chosen will help you examine your
    topic
  - A [Markdown
    table](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables) with
    5-10 key variables and their descriptions that you plan to use to
    examine your topic
