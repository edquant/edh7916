R is a port of the [S
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)),
which was developed at Bell Labs. As a [GNU
project](https://www.gnu.org), R is open source and free to use and
distribute. It can be installed and used on most major operating
systems.

R is best thought of as an integrated [language and
environment](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) that was designed
with statistical computing and data analysis in mind. To that end, its
structure is a balance between powerful mathematical computation and
high-level functionality that can be used interactively (unlike
compiled code). In other words, it's a great tool for quantitative
data analysis since it both allows you to investigate your data easily
and, when the time comes, write robust programs.

Originally, R was probably best known for its graphing
capabilities. As it has matured, it has [grown in popularity among
data
scientists](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/01/tiobe-2017.html),
who have increasingly [extended its functionality through
user-contributed
packages](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/01/cran-10000.html).
We will use a number of packages during this course.

## RStudio: an integrated development environment (IDE) for R

To work with the R language, it helps to have an application. While R
ships with one (you may have seen it on your computer after you
installed R), it's pretty plain. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com),
on the other hand, is a powerful integrated design environment (IDE)
that does most everything R-related very well and with little fuss:
run commands, write scripts, view output, interact with other
languages and remote site, _etc_. There are other options for working
with R, but RStudio is a great all-around program that we will use in
this course.

RStudio has 3-4 main frames:

1. Console
1. Script window (will be closed at first if you don't have any
   scripts open)
1. Environment / History / Connections
1. Files / Plots / Packages / Help / Viewer

Each has a useful purpose, but for today, we'll mostly focus on the
console itself.

## Assignment

## Assignment

```

R is a type of [object-oriented
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
environment. This means that R thinks of things in its world as
objects, which are like virtual boxes in which we can put things:
data, functions, and even other objects.

Before discussing data types and structures, the first lesson in R is
how to assign values to objects. In R ([for quirky
reasons](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2008/12/use-equals-or-arrow-for-assignment.html)),
the primary means of assignment is the arrow, `<-`, which is a less
than symbol, `<`, followed by a hyphen, `-`.

```{r}
## assign value to object x using <-
x <- 1
```

**NOTE**: You can also use a single equals sign, `=`, to assign a
value to an object: `x = 1`. Keep in mind, however, that since `=`
sometimes has other meanings in R and can be confused with `==`, which
is different, it's generally clearer to use `<-`.

### But's where's the output?

R does _exactly_ what you ask it to do --- no more, no less. If you
don't ask it to return something, either explicitly from a function or
implicitly by printing to the console, it won't. This can be _huge_
source of frustration to new users.

The good-ish news is that by default, R will print an object's
contents to the console if it's the only thing you type in. Many
functions similarly print to the console if you don't assign the
output to an object. You can see this when simply type a number or
character into the console.

```{r}
## when you input a number or character, R returns it back to you
1
"a"
```

Basically, you've just told R "Here's a `1`" and R said "The content
of `1` is `1`". Same for `"a"`. The initial number in the square
brackets (`[1]`) is telling you the index (place within the object) of
the first item. Since we only have one item, it's just `[1]`.

When you store something in an object, you can type the object's name
into the console to see what's in it.

```{r}
## what's in x?
x
```

A neat trick if you want to both assign a value _and_ see the results
printed to the output is to to wrap the entire line in `()`.

```{r}
## wrap in () to print after assignment
(x <- 5)
```

**A NOTE ON "GOOD-ISH"** Keep in mind how much data your object has /
might have when printing it to the console. For a small amount,
printing is just fine. But if you have, for example, a matrix with
1,000 columns and 1 million rows, printing might not be a useful
exercise. There are other ways, such as the function `head()` that
might be more useful in these situations.

## Comments

You may have noticed already, but comments in R are set off using the
hash or pound character at the beginning of the line: `#`. The comment
character tells R to ignore the line, that is, do not try to interpret
it as code you the user want run.

> #### Quick exercise 
> Type the phrase "This is a comment" directly into the R console both
> with and without a leading "#". What happens each time?

You may notice that I use two hashes. This is a stylistic tick that
has more to do with the editor I use than an R requirement. You can
use only a single `#` for your comments if you like.

## Data types and structures

R uses variety of data types and structures to represent and work with
data. There are many, but the major ones that you'll use most often are:

- `logical`
- `numeric` (`integer` & `double`)
- `character`
- `vector`
- `matrix`
- `list`
- `dataframe`

Understanding the nuanced differences between data types is not
important right now. Just know that they exist and that you'll gain an
intuitive understanding of them as you become better aquainted with
R.

## Packages

User-submitted packages are a huge part of what makes R great. You may
hear me use the phrases "base R" during class. What I mean by this is
the R that comes as you download it with no packages loaded (sometimes
also called "vanilla R"). While it's powerful in and of itself --- you
can do everything you need with base R --- most of your scripts will
make use of one of more contributed packages. These will make your
data analytic life _much_ nicer. We'll lean heavily on the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) suite of packages this
semester.

### Installing packages from CRAN

Many contributed packages are hosted on the [CRAN package
repository](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html). What's
really nice about CRAN is that packages have to go through quite a few
checks in order for CRAN to approve and host them. Checks include
making sure the package has documentation, works on a variety of
systems, and doesn't try to do odd things to your computer. The upshot
is that you should feel okay downloading these packages from CRAN.

To download a package from CRAN, use:

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
install.packages("<package name>")
```
**NOTE** Throughout this course, if you see something in triangle
brackets (`<...>`), that means it's a placeholder for you to change
accordingly. 

Many packages rely on other packages to function properly. When you
use `install.packages()`, the default option is to install all
dependencies. By default, R will check how you installed R and
download the right operating system file type.

> package, which is really a suite of packages that we'll use
> throughout the semester. Don't forget to use double quotation marks
> around the package name: `install.packages("tidyverse")`

### Loading package libraries

Package libraries can loaded in a number of ways, but the easiest
it to write:

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
library("<library name>")
```

where `"<library name>"` is the name of the package/library. You will
need to load these before you can use their functions in your
scripts. Typically, they are placed at the top of the script file.

For example, let's load the `tidyverse` library we just installed:

```{r}
## load library (note quirk that you don't need quotes here)
library(tidyverse)
```

Notice that when you load the tidyverse (which, again, is actually
loading a number of other libraries), you see a lot of output. Not all
packages are this noisy, but the information is useful here because it
shows all the libraries that are now loaded and ready for you to use.

## Help
```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## ---------------------------------------------------------
## Help
## ---------------------------------------------------------
```

I don't have every R function and nuance memorized, so I certainly
don't expect that you will. With all the user-written packages, it
would be difficult to keep up if I tried!  When stuck, there are a few
ways to get help.

### Help files

In the console, typing a function name immediately after a question
mark will bring up that function's help file (in RStudio, you should
see in the bottom right facet):

```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = FALSE, include = FALSE}
loadNamespace("printr")
```
```{r}
## get help file for function
?median
```

Two question marks will search for the command name in CRAN packages
(again, in the bottom right facet):

```{r}
## search for function in CRAN
??median
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = FALSE, include = FALSE}
unloadNamespace("printr")
```

At first, using help files may feel like trying to use a dictionary to
see how to spell a word --- if you knew how to spell it, you wouldn't
need the dictionary! Similarly, if you knew what you needed, you
wouldn't need the help file. But over time, they will become more
useful, particularly when you want to figure out an obscure option
that will give you _exactly_ what you need.

### Google it!

Google is a coder's best friend. If you are having a problem, odds are
a 1,000+ other people have too and at least one of them has been brave
enough to ask about it in a forum like
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com),
[CrossValidated](https://stackoverflow.com), or [R-help mailing
list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help).

If you are lucky, you'll find the _exact_ answer to your
question. More likely, you'll find a partial answer that you'll need
to modify for your needs. Sometimes, you'll find multiple partial
answers that, in combination, help you figure out a solution. It can
feel overwhelming at first, particularly if it's a way of
problem-solving that's different from what you're used to. But it does
become easier with practice.

Google it! 

### Asking for help: order of operations

When needing help for this class, your order of operations should be:

1. Try a lot on your own
2. R help files
3. Google
4. Class peern (directly or through our
   [Issues](https://github.com/edquant/edh7916/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)
   page)
5. Me

This is not because I don't want to help. My concern is the opposite:
that I'm likely to just show you. Data analysis is tricky because no
two problems are alike. But over time, they do rhyme. The time you put
in now learning to figure things out on your own will be well paid in
the future.
