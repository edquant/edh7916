UNIVERSITY MISSION
Santa Clara University is a Catholic and Jesuit institution that makes student learning its central focus, promotes faculty and staff learning in its various forms, and exhibits organizational learning as it deals with the challenges facing it.

Student learning takes place at the undergraduate and graduate level in an educa­tional environment that integrates rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagi­nation, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world.

As an academic community, we expand the boundaries of knowledge and insight through teaching, research, artistic expression, and other forms of scholarship. It is primarily through discovering, communicating, and applying knowledge that we exercise our institutional responsibility as a voice of reason and conscience in society.

We offer challenging academic programs and demonstrate a commitment to the development of:

Undergraduate students who seek an education with a strong humanistic orien­tation in a primarily residential setting.
Graduate students, many of them working professionals in Silicon Valley, who seek advanced degree programs that prepare them to make significant contribu­tions to their fields.

In addition to these core programs, we also provide a variety of continuing education and professional development opportunities for nonmatriculated students.

Through the use of industry-based advisory committees, employed graduate contacts, and faculty/industry interactions,
WyoTech continually upgrades and modifies programs to enhance each graduate's employability.

WyoTech's primary objectives are to impart specific knowledge and skills, to graduate each and every student who begins training, and to place them in their chosen fields.  In order to achieve these objectives, the curriculum, the faculty and staff, and the facilities and learning environment become equally important.
WyoTech's curricula allow students to concentrate exclusively on learning technical skills in certificate and diploma programs or to expand their education with occupational degree programs.

The faculty and staff respect the professional decision students have made to enter career training. We believe professionalism is as important an aspect of training as technical and business skills.  For that reason, WyoTech has established rules and regulations concerning attendance, behavior and academic performance in classrooms, labs and shops.  These rules are enforced, both on campus and in housing, and each student's grades are adjusted weekly to reflect professionalism points.  Professionalism develops a positive attitude, personal motivation, and career pride.  These elements, combined with technical expertise, produce a WyoTech graduate--a skilled professional technician."

This mission is the end by which all means are judged – from customs of community life to curricular decisions and faculty appointments, to building design and forms of governance. +++

To accomplish its mission, the College has a single, substantially unvarying program with no majors, minors, or electives. It consists in an integrated and orderly study of the liberal arts and sciences, beginning with the fundamental arts of the trivium and quadrivium, proceeding through the natural and political sciences, and culminating in theology. The College achieves its mission chiefly through reflective consideration of seminal questions raised in classical texts. These texts – often referred to as the “Great Books” – are selected by the faculty under the guidance of the Catholic tradition. In accordance with this tradition, the works of St. Thomas Aquinas occupy a preeminent position in the College’s curriculum. +++

Classes are seminars and tutorials: groups of fifteen to twenty students discussing the readings under the guidance of a faculty member. A laboratory program provides students laboratory experience in addition to the reading of primary texts. Tutorials, seminars, and laboratories are complemented by a lecture and concert series. This offers students an opportunity to witness and discuss the scholarly and artistic works of the wider community. +++

The College’s educational principles and curriculum arise from an intellectual tradition which does not fluctuate with the vicissitudes of time, founded as it is in a perennial wisdom by which the truth and merit of new insights and discoveries may be best understood. The College aims to sustain the natural wonder of students, to develop their intellectual virtues, and to help them satisfy their desire to know things noble and worth knowing."

Wabash offers qualified young men a superior education, fostering, in particular, independent intellectual inquiry, critical thought, and clear written and oral expression. The College educates its students broadly in the traditional curriculum of the liberal arts, while also requiring them to pursue concentrated study in one or more disciplines.

Wabash also challenges its students to appreciate the changing nature of the global society and prepares them for the responsibilities of leadership and service in it. 

The College carries out its mission in a residential setting in which students take personal and group responsibility for their actions. Wabash provides for its students an unusually informal, egalitarian, and participatory environment which encourages young men to adopt a life of intellectual and creative growth, self-awareness, and physical activity. The College seeks to cultivate qualities of character and leadership in students by developing not only their analytical skills, but also sensitivity to values, and judgment and compassion required of citizens living in a difficult and uncertain world.

We introduce them to the textual tradition of reason that illuminates such central features of modern life as democracy and technology, as well as to the literary and musical tradition of the West.  We are committed to the use of a list of great books that is both fairly stable and under continual review.  These are books agreed to be excellent, to form a coherent sequence, and to raise most cogently questions we want our students to consider.  We foster literacy in three kinds of texts:  verbal, mathematical, and musical.  We want our students to develop the intellectual virtues of courage in inquiry, caution in forming opinions, candor about their ignorance, open attentiveness to the words of their colleagues, industry in preparation, and meticulousness in verbal translations as well as in mathematical demonstrations.  We give our students the experience of living in a community of learning imbued with attitudes of consideration and respect that foster moral virtues appropriate to their future lives as citizens.  We think that the college has a wider mission in contributing to the invigoration of American education by giving help to other institutions that ask for it, by encouraging our students to become teachers, and by providing to a wide constituency occasions for actual learning in the spirit and through the materials of our program."

An individual with self-confidence, regardless of looks, will present a commanding and convincing Appearance, another success factor. To succeed, one must overcome obstacles and the energy and enthusiasm to do so derives from Ambition.  The “can do” Attitude has always been in demand and feeds both Ambition and Appearance.  Benjamin Franklin is quoted as saying “Human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day” and so we emphasize Attendance, the source of these small advantages, as a key success factor.  Our overall approach is to teach the basics of theory combined with practical experience and social experience through industry user group and association meetings. This provides students with the ability to analyze systems and solve problems and to see the application of their studies in the workplace.

	The Evangelical School of Theology, the graduate seminary of the Evangelical Congregational Church, educates and prepares persons for Christian vocation and service within the Church of Jesus Christ.

	The mission of Evangelical arises out of God's redemptive work in this world, effected through Jesus Christ, revealed through the Biblical Word and mediated by the Holy Spirit.  These principles give substance to the seminary’s life and values and inform its curriculum and activities.  The roots of the seminary are deep within the context, heritage and ethos of evangelical faith with its commitment to the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the Word of God written, the only authoritative and infallible rule for faith and life.

	Historically, the Seminary stands within the evangelical Wesleyan tradition of Protestant theology as set forth in the Twenty-Five Articles of Faith of the Evangelical Congregational Church.  The Seminary is committed to meet the ministerial training needs of the Evangelical Congregational Church, however, desiring to contribute to the larger Church, Evangelical considers it both a privilege and a responsibility to prepare students of other traditions.

	The role of the Seminary is to serve the Church in preparing men and women whose Christian character gives evidence of a knowledge of God in Christ.  Preparation involves the formation of the whole person – spiritually, emotionally, intellectually, physically, socially, and professionally.

Objectives

	The curriculum and program of Evangelical are designed to promote growth and development in the following areas:  Holy Scripture, Spiritual Formation, Academic Excellence, Leadership Development, Evangelistic Commitment, Global Perspective, Church and Society, and Denominational Relationships."

We view people as holistic, unique human beings with complex physical, emotional, social and spiritual needs. We also feel they, as clients, have a right to decide how to meet their health care needs and to participate in the process of meeting those needs. Practical Nurses make a unique and valuable contribution in helping clients to achieve an optimum level of health and wellness in a variety of health care settings. We feel it is important that Practical Nurses consider their clients' lifestyles, values and cultures as they care for their clients.
Nursing is a caring profession. It is both an art and a science. The practice of Nursing arises from a core of knowledge that integrates concepts from biological, psychological, social sciences and liberal arts. All nursing practice is adjusted to meet the needs of clients at their stage in the life cycle and to attain an optimum level of wellness as determined by actual or potential health problems. Nursing is always governed by legal and ethical parameters.
We believe leaning is a continuous process moving from the simple to the complex that leads to changes in student behavior. Learning is enhanced by active involvement on the part of the learner as well as interaction with faculty, both of which promote students' critical thinking and problem solving abilities. We believe Practical Nursing education should provide students with learning skills that prepare them for the changing needs and dictates of the health care delivery system and society.
Two defining statements from the Licensed Practical Nurses' national organizations help guide our curriculum toward preparing grades for practice.
The Practical Nurse utilizes specialized knowledge and skills which meet the health needs of people in a variety of settings under the direction of qualified health professionals. (NFLPN 1997)"

The intent is that they intervene actively in the regulatory, political and economic processes, at the regional as well as the national level.  The social relevance of our legal profession in today's Puerto Rico is dependent on our ability to transcend the adversative, economic and technical viewpoints that have dominated the profession in our times.
It is critical that jurists be formed as learned professionals, true analytical intellectuals and social engineers, dedicated to the active cultivation of knowledge and practices needed for a more just and efficient administration of justice, for the formulation of public policy on the island, and for the competitive intervention in the new global economic, judicial-political and cultural order.  Complete understanding of the social, political and valuative nature of law is essential, and of the primary social function that jurists serve as social conflict mediators, as counselors of the prescriptive processes in society, and, together with other groups of professionals, as organizers of social processes.  Thus they can contribute constructively to the development of our country and to the solution of problems that afflict our society.
Moreover, the traditional model of legal education creates a learning process that by and large concentrates on the transmission of information.  It has, likewise, a pernicious tendency to favor the courtroom as the almost exclusive stage for professional practice and within this forum, to favor adversative and litigious solutions, despite enormous costs that it entails, both economically and socially.

Occupational training is administered on an open-ended, open-exit training schedule.  When open-ended, open-exit schedules are not possible, traditional fixed start and end date programs will be scheduled.
Assigning tasks and asserting adherence to school regulations are needed to assure that achievement is obtained in the area of training.

WyoTech prepares students for the post graduation working world by teaching on a workday, not a school day schedule.  Most students attend classes approximately eight hours a day, five fays a week.

The faculty and staff respect the professional decision students have made to enter career training.  We believe professionalism is as important an aspect of training as are technical and business skills.  For that reason, WyoTech has established rules and regulations concerning attendance, behavior and academic performance in classrooms, labs and shops.  These rules are enforced, both on campus and in housing at the Wyoming campus, and each student's grades are adjusted weekly to reflect professionalism points.  Professionalism develops a positive attitude, personal motification, and career pride.  These elements, combined with technical expertise, produce a WyoTech graduate -- a skilled professional technician."
