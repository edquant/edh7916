<h1 id="a-system-of-version-control-introduction-to-git--github">A system of Version Control: Introduction to Git / GitHub</h1>

<p>From the git website <a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
speed and efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why-use-git">Why use git?</h2>

<p>With so many other (read: easier!) ways to share and collaborate on
documents, why use git? Isn’t it a bit overkill to learn an entirely new
syntax? Why not just email files or use something like DropBox? Because
it is very easy to end up with something like this:</p>

<h3 id="as-complexity-increases-so-does-the-need-for-git">As complexity increases, so does the need for git</h3>

<p>\[ Project = f(size, scope, collaborators) \]</p>

<p>As any part of that function grows, so too does the need for a work flow
that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allows for many moving parts</li>
  <li>Allows for peaceful collaboration (no overwrites)</li>
  <li>Allows for timely collaboration (synchronous)</li>
  <li>Allows for distant collaboration (centralized file location)</li>
  <li>Allows for version control (so you can go back if necessary)</li>
</ul>

<p>Git was designed to do all these things, so it works better than other
systems.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-difference-between-git-and-github">What’s the difference between git and GitHub?</h3>

<p>Yep, you guessed it. Git is the system/language that supports version
control. GitHub is an online service that will host your remote
repositories, for free if public or a small fee if private. (Students
get an education discount and some free repos. Check out
<a href="https://education.github.com/">https://education.github.com/</a>.)</p>

<p>RStudio is nice because it provides an nice point-and-click interface
for git. (<a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">Sourcetree</a> and <a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub
Desktop</a> are also really nice GUIs.) If you
want to run git at the command line, go for it! But using RStudio or
another GUI is fine.</p>

<h3 id="some-notes-on-work-flow-good-habits">Some notes on work flow (good habits)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Always <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull</code> from your local repo with your remote repo before
starting any work. This makes sure you have the latest files.
RStudio has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull</code> button in the <strong>Git</strong> tab.</li>
  <li>Don’t wait to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">push</code> your commits. Just like you save your papers
every few lines or paragraphs, you should push to your remote repo.
This way, you’re less likely to lose work in the event of a computer
crash. Also, should you want to return to a prior version, small
changes make it easier to find what you want.</li>
  <li>Add useful <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit</code> messages. RStudio will make you add something.
Don’t say “stuff.” A version history of 95 “stuff”s is pretty
non-helpful. Also, I would keep it clean. Even in a private
repository, work as if someone will see what you write someday.</li>
  <li>Don’t freak out! If you accidentally push and overwrite or delete
something on the remote, you can get it back. That’s the point of
version control! Sometimes weird things like merges happen (two
files with the same name are shoved together). They can be a pain to
fix, but they can be fixed.</li>
  <li>Avoid tracking overly large files and pushing them to your remote
repository. GitHub has a file size limit of 100 MB per file and 1 GB
per repo. The history of large files compounds quickly, so think
carefully before adding them. Usually this means that small datasets
are okay; big ones are better backed up somewhere else and left on
your machine.</li>
  <li>Remember: even in a private repository, your files are potentially
viewable. If any of your datasets or files are restricted, do no
push them remotely. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code> to make sure that git doesn’t
track or push them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Every class and work session should go like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull</code> from GitHub remote</li>
  <li><em>do work</em></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stage</code> (if new file)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit</code> with message</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">push</code> back to GitHub remote</li>
</ol>

<p>If you’d like you can also use terminal commands to accomplish the same
things. Many people (including me) like to use the terminal commands
directly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pull: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull</code></li>
  <li>Stage: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add &lt;filenames&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Committ: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m "&lt;your message here&gt;"</code></li>
  <li>Push: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code></li>
</ul>

<p>That said, you should use whatever works best for you.</p>

<p>By far the most useful guide to working with R and git/GitHub is <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/">Jenny
Bryan’s guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="some-more-notes-on-using-git-plain-text">Some more notes on using Git: plain text</h3>

<p>Git works best with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text">plain text
files</a>. This is because it
notes the differences across two plain text files rather than just
copying and re-copying the same file over and over again as it changes.
When you’ve only changed one word, git’s method of version control is
much more efficient than making a whole new copy.</p>

<p>It’s also useful when you need to merge two files. If file B is just
file A with new section, file B can be easily merged into file A by
inserting the new section — just like you would add a paragraph in a
paper you’re writing. R scripts are plain text. Some data files, like
*.csv, are plain text. This is why git works really well with data
analysis workflows.</p>

<p>On the other hand, git does not work as well with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file">binary
files</a>. These files are
stored in a format closer to what your computer understands, which comes
with benefits. Data files, like Stata’s <em>.dta and R’s *.Rdata, as well
as MS Office files — *.docx, *.xlsx, *.pptx, *etc</em> — are binary files.
Git will keep track of your MS Word document, but due to its underlying
structure, you won’t be able to merge and every small change will just
make a whole new copy of the file. This is why we generally don’t commit
large binary data files to Git: your repo just becomes larger and larger
with each small change to your data.</p>

  <h4 id="not-so-quick-exercise">Not-so-quick exercise</h4>

  <p>In this first exercise, we’ll practice using RStudio to pull down your
student repository from GitHub. We’ll also practice making a few quick
file changes, staging, commiting, and pushing them back to the remote.</p>

<h1 id="a-language-of-data-analysis-introduction-to-r">A Language of Data Analysis: Introduction to R</h1>

<p>R is a port of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_\(programming_language\)">S
language</a>,
which was developed at Bell Labs. As a <a href="https://www.gnu.org">GNU
project</a>, R is open source and free to use and
distribute. It can be installed and used on most major operating
systems.</p>

<p>R is best thought of as an integrated <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">language and
environment</a> that was designed
with statistical computing and data analysis in mind. To that end, its
structure is a balance between powerful mathematical computation and
high-level functionality that can be used interactively (unlike compiled
code). In other words, it’s a great tool for quantitative data analysis
since it both allows you to investigate your data easily and, when the
time comes, write robust programs.</p>

<p>Originally, R was probably best known for its graphing capabilities. As
it has matured, it has <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/01/tiobe-2017.html">grown in popularity among data
scientists</a>,
who have increasingly <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/01/cran-10000.html">extended its functionality through
user-contributed
packages</a>.
We will use a number of packages during this course.</p>

<h2 id="rstudio-an-integrated-development-environment-ide-for-r">RStudio: an integrated development environment (IDE) for R</h2>

<p>To work with the R language, it helps to have an application. While R
ships with one (you may see it on your computer as R.app), it’s pretty
plain. <a href="https://www.rstudio.com">RStudio</a>, on the other hand, is a
powerful IDE that does most everything R-related very well and with
little fuss: run commands, write scripts, view output, interact with
other languages and remote site, <em>etc</em>. There are other options for
working with R, but RStudio is a great all-around program that we will
use in this course.</p>

<p><img src="/edh7916/assets/img/rstudio_script.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>RStudio has 3-4 main frames:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Console</li>
  <li>Script window (will be closed at first if you don’t have any scripts
open)</li>
  <li>Environment / History / Connections</li>
  <li>Files / Plots / Packages / Help / Viewer</li>
</ol>

<p>Each has a useful purpose, but for today, we’ll mostly focus on the
console itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="quick-exercise">Quick exercise</h4>

  <p>If you haven’t already, try entering an equation in the console (like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 + 1</code>). Next, open the script associated with this module and run
the first line. Welcome to R!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>

<p>R is a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented
programming</a>
environment. This means that R thinks of things in its world as objects,
which are like virtual boxes in which we can put things: data,
functions, and even other objects.</p>

<p>Before discussing data types and structures, the first lesson in R is
how to assign values to objects. In R (<a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2008/12/use-equals-or-arrow-for-assignment.html">for quirky
reasons</a>),
the primary means of assignment is the arrow, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;-</code>, which is a less than
symbol, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code>, followed by a hyphen, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code>.</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## assign value to object x using &lt;-</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">1</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: You can also use a single equals sign, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code>, to assign a value
to an object: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x = 1</code>. Keep in mind, however, that since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code> sometimes
has other meanings in R and can be confused with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code>, which is
different, it’s generally clearer to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;-</code>.</p>

<h3 id="buts-wheres-the-output">But’s where’s the output?</h3>

<p>R does <em>exactly</em> what you ask it to do — no more, no less. If you don’t
ask it to return something, either explicitly from a function or
implicitly by printing to the console, it won’t. This can be <em>huge</em>
source of frustration to new users.</p>

<p>The good-ish news is that by default, R will print an object’s contents
to the console if it’s the only thing you type in. Many functions
similarly print to the console if you don’t assign the output to an
object. You can see this when simply type a number or character into the
console.</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## when you input a number or character, R returns it back to you</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[1] 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[1] "a"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basically, you’ve just told R “Here’s a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>” and R said “The content of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>”. Same for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"a"</code>. The initial number in the square brackets
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[1]</code>) is telling you the index (place within the object) of the first
item. Since we only have one item, it’s just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[1]</code>.</p>

<p>When you store something in an object, you can type the object’s name
into the console to see what’s in it.</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## what's in x?</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[1] 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A neat trick if you want to both assign a value <em>and</em> see the results
printed to the output is to to wrap the entire line in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">()</code>.</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## wrap in () to print after assignment</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">5</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[1] 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="quick-exercise-1">Quick exercise</h4>

  <p>Using the arrow, assign the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 + 1</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>. Next subtract 1
from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and reassign the result to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>. Show the value in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>A NOTE ON “GOOD-ISH”</strong> Keep in mind how much data your object has /
might have when printing it to the console. For a small amount, printing
is just fine. But if you have, for example, a matrix with 1,000 columns
and 1 million rows, printing might not be a useful exercise. There are
other ways, such as the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head()</code> that might be more useful in
these situations.</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>You may have noticed already, but comments in R are set off using the
hash or pound character at the beginning of the line: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code>. The comment
character tells R to ignore the line, that is, do not try to interpret
it as code you the user want run.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="quick-exercise-2">Quick exercise</h4>

  <p>Type the phrase “This is a comment” directly into the R console both
with and without a leading “#”. What happens each time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may notice that I use two hashes. This is a stylistic tick that has
more to do with the editor I use than an R requirement. You can use only
a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> for your comments if you like.</p>

<h2 id="data-types-and-structures">Data types and structures</h2>

<p>R uses variety of data types and structures to represent and work with
data. There are many, but the major ones that you’ll use most often are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logical</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numeric</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">integer</code> &amp; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">character</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vector</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matrix</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dataframe</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Understanding the nuanced differences between data types is not
important right now. Just know that they exist and that you’ll gain an
intuitive understanding of them as you become better aquainted with R.
For more information, see the <a href="./types_structures.html">supplemental material on data types and
structures</a>.</p>

<h2 id="packages">Packages</h2>

<p>User-submitted packages are a huge part of what makes R great. You may
hear me use the phrases “base R” during class. What I mean by this is
the R that comes as you download it with no packages loaded (sometimes
also called “vanilla R”). While it’s powerful in and of itself — you can
do everything you need with base R — most of your scripts will make use
of one of more contributed packages. These will make your data analytic
life <em>much</em> nicer. We’ll lean heavily on the
<a href="https://www.tidyverse.org">{tidyverse}</a> suite of packages this
semester.</p>

<h3 id="installing-packages-from-cran">Installing packages from CRAN</h3>

<p>Many contributed packages are hosted on the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html">CRAN package
repository</a>.
What’s really nice about CRAN is that packages have to go through quite
a few checks in order for CRAN to approve and host them. Checks include
making sure the package has documentation, works on a variety of
systems, and doesn’t try to do odd things to your computer. The upshot
is that you should feel okay downloading these packages from CRAN.</p>

<p>To download a package from CRAN, use:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">install.packages</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"&lt;package name&gt;"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> Throughout this course, if you see something in triangle
brackets (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;...&gt;</code>), that means it’s a placeholder for you to change
accordingly.</p>

<p>Many packages rely on other packages to function properly. When you use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">install.packages()</code>, the default option is to install all dependencies.
By default, R will check how you installed R and download the right
operating system file type.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="quick-exercise-3">Quick exercise</h4>

  <p>Install the
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyverse"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{tidyverse}</code></a> package,
which is really a suite of packages that we’ll use throughout the
semester. Don’t forget to use double quotation marks around the
package name.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="loading-package-libraries">Loading package libraries</h3>

<p>Package libraries can loaded in a number of ways, but the easiest it to
write:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">library</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"&lt;library name&gt;"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"&lt;library name&gt;"</code> is the name of the package/library. You will
need to load these before you can use their functions in your scripts.
Typically, they are placed at the top of the script file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="quick-exercise-4">Quick exercise</h4>

  <p>Load the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tidyverse</code> package, which you just installed. This will be a
good test of the installation since we will use tidyverse libraries
throughout the rest of the workshop.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="help">Help</h2>

<p>Even I don’t have every R function and nuance memorized. With all the
user-written packages, it would be difficult to keep up if I tried!
When stuck, there are a few ways to get help.</p>

<h3 id="help-files">Help files</h3>

<p>In the console, typing a function name immediately after a question mark
will bring up that function’s help file:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## get help file for function</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="o">?</span><span class="n">median</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Median Value

Description:

     Compute the sample median.

Usage:

     median(x, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
     
Arguments:

       x: an object for which a method has been defined, or a numeric
          vector containing the values whose median is to be computed.

   na.rm: a logical value indicating whether 'NA' values should be
          stripped before the computation proceeds.

     ...: potentially further arguments for methods; not used in the
          default method.

Details:

     This is a generic function for which methods can be written.
     However, the default method makes use of 'is.na', 'sort' and
     'mean' from package 'base' all of which are generic, and so the
     default method will work for most classes (e.g., '"Date"') for
     which a median is a reasonable concept.

Value:

     The default method returns a length-one object of the same type as
     'x', except when 'x' is logical or integer of even length, when
     the result will be double.

     If there are no values or if 'na.rm = FALSE' and there are 'NA'
     values the result is 'NA' of the same type as 'x' (or more
     generally the result of 'x[FALSE][NA]').

Examples:

     median(1:4)                # = 2.5 [even number]
     median(c(1:3, 100, 1000))  # = 3 [odd, robust]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Two question marks will search for the command name in CRAN packages:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## search for function in CRAN</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="o">??</span><span class="n">median</span><span class="w">

<p>At first, using help files may feel like trying to use a dictionary to
see how to spell a word — if you knew how to spell it, you wouldn’t need
the dictionary! Similarly, if you knew what you needed, you wouldn’t
need the help file. But over time, they will become more useful,
particularly when you want to figure out an obscure option that will
give you <em>exactly</em> what you need.</p>

<h3 id="google-it">Google it!</h3>

<p>Google is a coder’s best friend. If you are having a problem, odds are a
1,000+ other people have too and at least one of them has been brave
enough to ask about it in a forum like
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>,
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com">CrossValidated</a>, or <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help">R-help mailing
list</a>.</p>

<p>If you are lucky, you’ll find the <em>exact</em> answer to your question. More
likely, you’ll find a partial answer that you’ll need to modify for your
needs. Sometimes, you’ll find multiple partial answers that, in
combination, help you figure out a solution. It can feel overwhelming at
first, particularly if it’s a way of problem-solving that’s different
from what you’re used to. But it does become easier with practice.</p>

<p>Google it!</p>

<h3 id="asking-for-help-order-of-operations">Asking for help: order of operations</h3>

<p>When needing help for this class, your order of operations should be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Try a lot on your own</li>
  <li>R help files</li>
  <li>Google</li>
  <li>Class peer</li>
  <li>Me</li>
</ol>

<p>This is not because I don’t want to help. My concern is the opposite:
that I’m likely to just show you. Data analysis is tricky because no two
problems are alike. But over time, they do rhyme. The time you put in
now learning to figure things out on your own will be well paid in the
future.</p>
