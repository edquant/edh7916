<p>Now that we’ve learned a variety of data wrangling tasks, we’ll take
some time to discuss good workflow, that is, moving from raw data to
data that are ready for analysis. In the lessons and assignments we’ve
had so far, we’ve actually already covered many of the major points
that are discussed below. This lesson, therefore, is one part review
and one part making explicit the good practices that we’ve implicitly
followed.</p>

<h1 id="organization">Organization</h1>

<p>From the <a href="../lessons/organizing.html">organizing lesson</a>, we’ve been
very concerned about how our project is organized. This includes both
the directory of folders and files on our machine and the scripts that
run our analyses.</p>

<h2 id="project-directory">Project directory</h2>

<p>While it is certainly <em>easier</em> on the front end to store all project
files in a single folder</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./project
|
|--+ analysis.R
|--+ clean.R
|--+ clean_data.rds
|--+ data1.csv
|--+ data2.csv
|--+ histogram_x.png
|--+ density_z.png
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>it’s better to separate files by type/purpose in your project
directory (“a place for everything and everything in its place”):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./project
|
|__/data
|   |--+ clean_data.rds
|   |--+ data1.csv
|   |--+ data2.csv
|__/figures
|   |--+ histogram_x.png
|   |--+ density_z.png
|__/scripts 
    |--+ analysis.R
    |--+ clean.R
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just like there’s something to be said for visiting the library in
order to scan titles in a particular section — it’s easier to get an
idea of what’s available by looking at the shelf than by scanning
computer search output — it’s useful to be able to quickly scan only
the relevant files in a project. With well-named files (discussed
below) and an organized directory structure, a replicator may be able
to guess the purpose, flow, and output of your project without even
running your code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="quick-question">Quick question</h4>
  <p>When using a project directory instead of just a single folder, we
need to use file paths. In particular, we use <em>relative paths</em>
rather than <em>fixed paths</em>. Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="script">Script</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../lessons/organizing.html">lesson on organizing</a>, I
also shared a template R script. While you do not need to use my
particular template — in fact, you should modify it to meet your
needs — it does follow a few organizational rules that you should
follow as well.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clear header with information about the project, this file, and
you.</li>
  <li>Load libraries, set paths and macros, and write functions towards
the top of the file.</li>
  <li>Clear sections for reading in data, process, and output
(ingredients, recipe, prepared dish).</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="quick-question-1">Quick question</h4>
  <p>Why put things like file paths or macros at the top of the file?</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="clarity">Clarity</h1>

<p>Remember: even though our scripts are instructions for the computer,
they are also meant to be read by us humans. How well you comment your
code and how well you name your objects, scripts, data, output, <em>etc</em>,
determine the clarity of your intent.</p>

<h2 id="commenting">Commenting</h2>

<p>Don’t assume that your intent is clear. Particularly because so much
working code comes as the result of many (…many…many…) revisions
to non-working code, it’s very important that you comment liberally.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are you doing?
    <div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## Creating a dummy variable for each state from current categorical variable</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Why are you doing it this way?
    <div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## Converting 1/2 indicator to 0/1 so 1 == variable name</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Links to supporting documents/websites
    <div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## see &lt;url&gt; for data codebook</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Hat-tip (h/t) for borrowed code
    <div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## h/t &lt;url&gt; for general code that I slightly modified </span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Formula / logic behind method
    <div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## log(xy) = log(x) + log(y)</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="c1">## using logarithms for more numerically stable calculations </span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of these items are good uses for comments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="quick-question-2">Quick question</h4>
  <p>In which situation are comments not useful?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>

<p>For R, all the following objects are functionally equivalent:</p>
<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## v.1</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Alabama"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"Alaska"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"Arkansas"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="c1">## v.2</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">stuff</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Alabama"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"Alaska"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"Arkansas"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="c1">## v.3</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">cities</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Alabama"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"Alaska"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"Arkansas"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="c1">## v.4</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">states</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Alabama"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"Alaska"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"Arkansas"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>However, only the last object, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">states</code>, makes logical sense to us
based on its contents. So while R will work just as happily with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stuff</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cities</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">states</code>, a collaborator will appreciate
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">states</code> since it gives an idea of what it contains (or should contain) —
even without running the code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="quick-question-3">Quick question</h4>
  <p>Without seeing the initial object assignment, what might you expect to
see as output from the following code coming from a fellow higher
education researcher? Why?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When objects are well named, your code may become largely
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting_code">self-documenting</a>,
which is particularly nice since you don’t have to worry about drift
between your comments and code over time.</p>

<h1 id="automation">Automation</h1>

<p>In the <a href="../lessons/programming.html">functional programming
lesson</a>, we discussed the
difference between <strong>D</strong>on’t <strong>R</strong>epeat <strong>Y</strong>ourself programming and
<strong>W</strong>rite <strong>E</strong>very <strong>T</strong>ime programming. As much as possible and
within the dictates of organizing and clarity, it’s a good idea to
automate as much as you can.</p>

<h2 id="push-button-replication">Push-button replication</h2>

<p>In general, the goal for an analysis script — in particular, a
replication script — is that it will run from top to bottom with no
errors by <em>just pushing a button</em>. What I mean by this is that I want
to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the project directory</li>
  <li>Open the script in R Studio</li>
  <li>(If necessary, make sure I’m in the correct working directory)</li>
  <li>Push the “Run” button and have all the analyses run with all
estimates/figures/tables being produced and sent to their proper
project folders.</li>
</ol>

<p>The dream!</p>

<p>When projects are complicated or data isn’t easily shared (or can’t be
shared), the push button replication may not be feasible. But your
goal should always be to get as close to that as possible. Make your
life a little harder so your collaborators, replicators — and future
you! — have it a little easier.</p>

<p><strong>ONE NOTE</strong> Like writing a paper, the process going from a blank
script to a final product typically isn’t linear. You’ll have starts
and stops, dead-ends and rewrites. You shouldn’t expect a polished
paper from the first draft, and you shouldn’t expect to code up a
fully replicable script from the get-go.</p>

<p>There’s something to be said for just getting your ideas down on
paper, no matter how messy. Similarly, it may be better to <em>just get
your code to work first</em> and then clean it up later. My only warning
here is that while you have to clean up a paper eventually (someone’s
going to read it), code still remains largely hidden from public
view. There will be a temptation to get it to work and then move
on since “no one will see it anyway, right…<em>right?</em>” Fight that urge!</p>

<p>Just like real debt, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical
debt</a> that you take out
each time you settle for a hacky solution that’s <em>good enough</em> can
grow exponentially. At some point, the bill will come due in the form
of obviously (or even scarier, not-so-obviously) incorrect
results. Tracking down the source of errors for large projects or
those that reuse code from past projects can be maddening. Take a
little extra time to write good code now and it will pay dividends in
saved hours down the road, not to mention fewer 2 a.m. cold-sweat
awakenings, <em>Is that weird finding maybe because I constructed my main
outcome variable wrong…wait, how <strong>did</strong> I code that…</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="quick-question-4">Quick question</h4>
  <p>In a world in which not everyone knows how to use R, what’s another
benefit of push-button automation?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="multiple-scripts">Multiple scripts</h2>

<p>We’ve only worked with one script so far, but you can use the
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/source.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source()</code>
function</a>
in R to call other R scripts. For a very large project, you may decide
to have multiple scripts. For example, you may have one script that
downloads data, one that cleans the data, one that performs the
analyses, and one that makes the figures.</p>

<p>Rather than telling a would-be replicator to “run the following files
in the following order”</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_data.R</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clean_data.R</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">do_analysis.R</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make_figures.R</code></li>
</ol>

<p>you could instead include a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_all.R</code> script that only sources each
script in order and tell the replicator to run that:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## To run all analyses, set the working directory to "scripts" and</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="c1">## enter</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="c1">##</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="c1">## source("./run_all.R")</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="c1">##</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="c1">## into the console. </span><span class="w">

</span><span class="c1">## download data</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"./get_data.R"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="c1">## clean data</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"./clean_data.R"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="c1">## run analyses</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"./do_analysis.R"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="c1">## make figures</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"./make_figures.R"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not only is that easier for others to run, you now have a single
script that makes your analytic workflow much clearer. Note that there
are other ways to do something like this, such as using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile">makefiles</a>, though using only
R works pretty well.</p>

<p>Here are some replication examples for projects that I’ve done:</p>

<a href="https://github.com/btskinner">GitHub profile</a>. As you complete
projects and create replication scripts, be sure to make them
accessible. Not only is it good for the field, it also signals strong
transparency and credibility on your part as a researcher.</p>

<h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>

<p>As you wrangle your data, you should take advantage of your computer’s
power not only to perform the munging tasks you require, but also to
test that inputs and outputs are as expected.</p>

<h2 id="expected-data-values">Expected data values</h2>

<p>Let’s say you are investigating how college students use their
time. You have data from a time use study in which 3,000 students
recorded how they spent every hour for a week. The data come to you at
the student-week level and grouped by activity type. This means you
see that Student A spent 15 hours working, 20 hours studying/doing
homework, <em>etc</em>. You create a new column that adds the time for all
categories together and take the summary. You find:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">variable</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">mean</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">sd</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">min</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">max</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">total_hrs</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">167.99</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">1.93</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">152.48</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">183.46</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Something is wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="quick-question-5">Quick question</h4>
  <p>What’s wrong?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than going through an ad-hoc set of “ocular” checks, you can
build in more formal checks. We’ve done a little of this when using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">identical()</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all.equal()</code> to compare data frames. You could build
these into your scripts. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>summing activity hours in a week, check if any exceed the total
number of hours that are possible</li>
  <li>reading in data with student GPAs, check if they are negative</li>
  <li>combining data from 100 students at 5 schools, make sure your final
data frame has 500 rows</li>
  <li>creating a new percentage from two values, check that the value
between 0 and 100 (or between 0 and 1 if a proportion)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use simple tests to check, and include a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stop()</code> command
inside an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if()</code> statement:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## halt if max number of months is greater than 12 since data are only</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="c1">## for one year</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">max</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">length</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">months</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">12</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="n">stop</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Reported months greater than 12! Check!"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This only works if you know your data. Knowing your data requires both
domain knowledge (“Why are summer enrollments so much higher than fall
enrollments…that doesn’t make sense.”) and particular knowledge
about your data (“All values of <em>x</em> between 50 and 100, except these
two, which are -1 and 20000…something’s up”).</p>

<h2 id="expected-output-from-functions">Expected output from functions</h2>

<p>Programmers are big on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit
testing</a> their
functions. This simply means giving their functions or applications
very simple input that <em>should</em> correspond to straightforward output
and confirming that that is the case.</p>

<p>For example, if their function could have three types of output
depending on the input, they run at least three tests, one for each
type of output they expect to see. In practice, they might run many
more tests for all kinds of conditions — even those that should
“break” the code to make sure the proper errors or warnings are
returned.</p>

<p>As data analysts, you are unlikely to need to conduct a full testing
regime for each project. But if you write your own functions, you
should definitely stress test them a bit. This testing shouldn’t be in
your primary script but rather in another script, perhaps called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tests.R</code>. These can be informal tests such as</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## should return TRUE</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">function_to_return_1</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>or more sophisticated tests using R’s
<a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org">testthat</a> library.</p>

<p>Again, the point isn’t that you spend all your time writing unit
tests. But spending just a bit of time checking that your functions do
what you think they do will go a long way.</p>

<h2 id="fail-loudly-and-awkwardly">Fail loudly and awkwardly</h2>

<p>There is a notion in software development that a program should <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceful_exit">fail
gracefully</a>, which means
that when a problem occurs, the program should at the very least
give the user a helpful error message rather than just stopping
without note or looping forever until the machine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire_(computing)">halts and
catches fire</a>.</p>

<p>As data analysts, I want your scripts to do the opposite: I want your
code to exit loudly and awkwardly if there’s a problem. You aren’t
writing a program but rather an analysis. Therefore, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience">UX</a> I care about is
the reader of your final results and your future replicators. Rather
than moving forward silently when <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7">something strange
happens</a>
— which is lovely on the front end because everything keeps running
but deadly on the back end — your code should stop and yell at you
when something unexpected happens. It’s annoying, but that’s the
point.</p>

<h1 id="four-stages-of-data-a-taxonomy">Four stages of data: a taxonomy</h1>

<p>In the lessons so far, we’ve generally read in raw data, done some
processing that we printed to the console, and then finished. This is
fine for our small lessons and assignments, but in your own work, you
will often want to save your changes to the data along the way —
that is, save updated data files at discrete points in your data
analysis. This is particularly true for large projects in which
wrangling your data is distinct from its analysis and you don’t want
to run each part every time.</p>

<p>Broadly, there are four stages of data:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Raw data</li>
  <li>Built data (objective changes)</li>
  <li>Clean data (subjective changes)</li>
  <li>Analysis data</li>
</ol>

<p>For small projects, you may not end up with data files for each
stage. That said, your workflow should be organized in terms of moving
from one stage to the next.</p>

<p>We’ll talk about each below.</p>

<p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong> I want to give a quick hat tip to two people who’ve
really helped me clarify my thinking about these stages of data, <a href="https://twitter.com/wdoyle42">Will
Doyle</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SallyLHudson">Sally
Hudson</a>: Will for first showing the
importance of keeping raw data untouched; and Sally for showing how
useful it is to make a distinction between objective and subjective
data processing, particularly in large projects. Thanks and credit to
both.</p>

<h2 id="raw-data">Raw data</h2>

<p>Raw data, that is, the data you scrape, download, receive from an
advisor or research partner, <em>etc</em>, are sacrosanct. Do not change
them! They are to be read into R (or whatever software you use) and
that is all.</p>

<p>You will be tempted from time to time to <em>just fix this one thing</em>
that is wonky about the data. Maybe you have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.csv</code> file that has a
bunch of junk notes written above the actual data table (not
uncommon). The temptation will be to delete those rows so you have a
clean file. NO! There are ways to skip rows in a file like this, for
example. R is particularly good at reading in a large number of data
types with a large number of special situations.</p>

<p>If you are at all concerned that you or a collaborator may
accidentally save over your raw files, your operating system will
allow you to change the file permissions such that they are
<strong>read-only files</strong> (Dropbox will let you protect files in this way,
too). Particularly if working with a number of collaborators,
protecting your raw data files in this way is a good idea.</p>

<h2 id="built-data-objective-changes">Built data (objective changes)</h2>

<p>As a first step in processing your data, you should only make
<em>objective modifications</em>. What do I mean by objective? They are
those modifications that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Are required to get your data in good working order</li>
  <li>Are modifications that will always be needed across projects using
the same data (in the context of multiple projects)</li>
</ol>

<p>To the first point, let’s say you receive student-level administrative
data that includes a column, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">state</code>, that is the student’s home
state. However, values in the column include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Kentucky"</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"KY"</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Ken"</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"21"</code> (state FIPS code)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another example would be a date column, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">month</code>, in which you see:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"February"</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Feb"</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"2"</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, it’s clear that you want a consistent format for the
data. Whatever you pick, these are objective changes that you would
make at this time.</p>

<p>To the second point, let’s say this same administrative data are going
to be used across multiple projects. In each project, you need to
compute the proportion of in-state vs. out-of-state students. The data
column that indicates this is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">residency</code> and is coded (with no
data labels) as</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> := in-state</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code> := out-of-state</li>
</ul>

<p>Coming back to the data later and taking a look at the first few rows
in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">residency</code>, will it be clear</p>

<ul>
  <li>what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">residency</code> means?</li>
  <li>what the values of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code> represent?</li>
</ul>

<p>No.</p>

<p>An objective change that you can use across analyses will be to make a
new column called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">instate</code> in which</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> := out-of-state</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> := in-state</li>
</ul>

<p>The benefits are three-fold:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> are logically coded as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FALSE</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TRUE</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">instate</code> gives a direction to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>s and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>s: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> means in-state</li>
  <li>taking the mean of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">instate</code> will give you the proportion of
in-state students in your data</li>
</ul>

<p>If your data or project (or number of projects) is large, you many
want to save data files after your objective wrangling. These can be
reused across projects, which will make sure that objective data
wrangling decisions are consistent.</p>

<h2 id="clean-data-subjective-changes">Clean data (subjective changes)</h2>

<p>Whatever changes are left over after you’ve make objective changes are
<em>subjective</em> changes. These changes are project and analysis
specific.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say your student-level administrative data have
information about the student’s <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc01g.htm">expected family contribution or
EFC</a>. In your data, you have
the actual values. However, you want to compare your data to other
published research in which EFC is binned into discrete
categories. This means that in order to make a comparison, you have to
bin your data the same way. This is a subjective task for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there’s not an <em>objective</em> reason to bin your data in this manner,
<em>i.e.</em> to make the data consistent or clearer</li>
  <li>it’s unlikely you’ll need this new column of data for other projects</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other subjective changes you might make to a data set:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create an indicator variable that equals <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> when a student’s family
income is below $35,000/year (why $30k? why not $25k or $35k?)</li>
  <li>convert institutional enrollments to the log scale (do you always
need to do this?)</li>
  <li>join in data on the unemployment rate in the student’s county (do
you always need this information at the county level? at all?)</li>
</ul>

<p>But wait! Maybe you <em>do</em> want to use the binned value of EFC in
multiple projects — perhaps the binned categories are standard
across the literature — or the other examples appear always useful
and otherwise standard. Isn’t that <em>objective</em>?</p>

<p>Maybe!</p>

<p>The thing about determining the difference between <em>objective</em> vs
<em>subjective</em> cleaning is that on the margins, well, it’s subjective!
The point is not to have hard and fast rules, but rather to do your
best to clearly separate those data wrangling tasks that must be done
for the sake of consistency and clarity versus those that may change
depending on your research question(s).</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="quick-question-7">Quick question</h4>
  <p>What might be some other <em>subjective</em> data wrangling tasks? Think
about other research you’ve conducted or seen. Or think about what
our lessons and assignments so far: what have been subjective tasks?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="analysis-data">Analysis data</h2>

<p>Finally, analysis data are data that are properly structured for the
analysis you want to run (or the table or figure you want to make). In
many cases, your analysis data set will be the same as your clean data
set:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s in the shape you want (rectangular, with observations in rows
and variables in columns)</li>
  <li>it has all the variables you need to compute summary statistics or
run regression models</li>
</ul>

<p>Most R statistical routines (<em>e.g.</em>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mean()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sd()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lm()</code>) do a
fair amount of data wrangling under the hood to make sure it can do
what you ask. For example, you may have missing values (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NA</code>) in your
clean data set, but R’s linear model function, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lm()</code>, will just drop
observations with missing values by default. If you are okay with that
in your analysis, R can handle it.</p>

<p>However, for some special models or figures, you may need to reshape
or pre-process your clean data in one last step before running the
specific analysis you want. For example, your clean data frame may
have a column of parental occupational field (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parocc</code>) as a categorical
variable in which the first few categories are</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">11</code> := Management Occupations</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">13</code> := Business and Financial Operations Occupations</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">15</code> := Computer and Mathematical Occupations</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">17</code> := Architecture and Engineering Occupations</li>
</ul>

<p>…and so on. You want to run an analysis in which you can’t use this
categorical variable but instead need a vector of dummy variables,
that is, converting this single column into a bunch of columns that
only take on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> values if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parocc</code> equals that occupation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manage_occ == 1</code> if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parocc == 11</code> else <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manage_occ == 0</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">busfin_occ == 1</code> if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parocc == 13</code> else <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">busfin_occ == 0</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commat_occ == 1</code> if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parocc == 15</code> else <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commat_occ == 0</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arceng_occ == 1</code> if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parocc == 17</code> else <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arceng_occ == 0</code></li>
</ul>

<p>…and so on. Particularly if</p>

<ul>
  <li>your data are large</li>
  <li>the analysis takes a while to run</li>
  <li>you want to use the same data set up for multiple (but not all)
models or analytic tasks</li>
</ul>

<p>you may want to save this particular analysis data set.</p>

<p>As with the difference between <em>objective</em> and <em>subjective</em> data, the
difference between <em>subjective</em> and <em>analysis</em> data does not align to
a set of hard and fast rules. That’s okay! The main point is that as a
data analyst, you make data wrangling decisions thinking about how you
will go from <em>raw</em> to <em>objective</em> to <em>subjective</em> to <em>analysis</em> data
in a logical and clear manner. Collaborators, replicators, and future
you will appreciate it!</p>
