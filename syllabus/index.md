## Grading

Requirements for class attendance and make-up exams, assignments, and
other work in this course are consistent with university policies that
can be found [here](
https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/attendance.aspx).
Grades are assigned in accordance with current UF grading policies,
which may be found [here](
https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/grades.asp)

## Honor code 

UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states, 

> We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to
> hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honor and
> integrity by abiding by the Honor Code. On all work submitted for
> credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge
> is either required or implied: “On my honor, I have neither given nor
> received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment.”  

The [Honor Code](http://www.dso.ufl.edu/sccr/process/student-conduct-honor-code/)
specifies a number of behaviors that are in violation of this code and
the possible sanctions. Furthermore, you are obligated to report any
condition that facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate
personnel. If you have any questions or concerns, please consult with
the instructor or TAs in this class.  

## Accommodations 

Students with disabilities who experience learning barriers and would
like to request academic accommodations should [connect with the
disability Resource
Center](https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/). It is
important for students to share their accommodation letter with their
instructor and discuss their access needs, as early as possible in the
semester.  

## Course evaluations 

Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback
on the quality of instruction in this course by completing course
evaluations online via GatorEvals. Guidance on how to give feedback in
a professional and respectful manner is available
[here](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/). Students will be
notified when the evaluation period opens, and can complete
evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals, in their
Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, or
[here](https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/). Summaries of course evaluation
results are available to students
[here](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/).
  
## In-class recording

Students are allowed to record video or audio of class
lectures. However, the purposes for which these recordings may be used
are strictly controlled. The only allowable purposes are (1) for per-
sonal educational use, (2) in connection with a complaint to the
university, or (3) as evidence in, or in preparation for, a criminal
or civil proceeding. All other purposes are prohibited. Specifically,
students may not publish recorded lectures without the written consent
of the instructor.  

A "class lecture" is an educational presentation intended to inform or
teach enrolled students about a particular subject, including any
instructor-led discussions that form part of the presentation, and
delivered by any instructor hired or appointed by the University, or
by a guest instructor, as part of a University of Florida course. A
class lecture does not include lab sessions, student presentations,
clinical presentations such as patient history, academic exercises
involving solely student participa- tion, assessments (quizzes, tests,
exams), field trips, private conversations between students in the
class or between a student and the faculty or lecturer during a class
session.  

Publication without permission of the instructor is prohibited. To
"publish" means to share, trans- mit, circulate, distribute, or
provide access to a recording, regardless of format or medium, to an-
other person (or persons), including but not limited to another
student within the same class section. Additionally, a recording, or
transcript of a recording, is considered published if it is posted on
or uploaded to, in whole or in part, any media platform, including but
not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or
third party note/tutoring services. A student who publishes a
recording without written consent may be subject to a civil cause of
action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or
discipline under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student
Conduct Code.  

## A note about taking class during the COVID-19 pandemic


The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt the ways we live
each day. We are each trying to keep to "normal" routines all while
attending to our health and the health of those we care
about---sometimes nearby and sometimes from far away. I find this
difficult and I imagine that you might as well.

Two things are true this term. On one hand, we are to continue working
with and learning from one another. It's what we do as scholars, yet
more mundanely, taking this course also represents progress toward
your degree and career goals, which haven’t necessarily paused. On the
other hand, many of the structures that support your academic progress
are currently lacking and, in some cases, non-existent. People are
different. Some will appreciate the distraction that coursework can
offer; others will find it difficult to concentrate. During this term,
you may yourself alternate between being both of these people.

All of this is to say that flexible will be our watchword this
semester. In the next pages, you will see the assignments that
determine your grade as well as the tentative course schedule. Who
knows what this semester will bring, so if you will be flexible with
me, I promise to be flexible with you. This is my typical policy, but
I want to make it explicit this term. If you are having difficulties,
please let me know so that we can do whatever needs to be done for you
to be well and successful. You need not share personal details---please
simply keep me in the loop.
